# DVR Window (Plan)

Roadmap and phase status. Technical design (protocols, media bridge,
known device quirks) is in `ARCHITECTURE.md`; current device state and
credentials pointer are in `MEMORY.md`.

## Goal

A **standalone Linux service + local web UI** replacing Windows'
closed-source `LocalServiceControl.exe` local-service plugin — live
view, playback, snapshot, download, PTZ — built entirely on Hikvision's
documented, open protocols (ISAPI + RTSP), not any closed-source SDK.
Rationale in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Milestones

| Phase | Status | What |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ✅ done | Device recon — confirm ISAPI/RTSP paths, auth, channel/PTZ capability against the physical DVR |
| 1 | ✅ done | Backend core — config, ISAPI client, `/api/channels` |
| 2 | ✅ done | Live view — mediamtx bridge, `/api/streams`, live grid UI |
| 3 | ✅ done | PTZ — channels 9/10 (IP-proxy cameras) got PTZ hardware; `/api/ptz/{channelId}/{continuous,stop}` + live-view D-pad. Analog channels 1-4 still have no PTZ hardware. |
| 4 | ✅ done | Playback & search — `/api/recordings`, `/api/playback/{start,stop}`, playback UI |
| 5 | ✅ done | Snapshot & download — `/api/snapshot`, `/api/download` |
| 6 | ⬜ next | Polish/packaging — systemd service, playback-path GC, event/alarm stream, basic auth on the local UI |
| 7 | ✅ done | Continuous playback across recording-segment boundaries — auto-advance into the next segment instead of freezing at the end of one; skip forward over a real recording gap instead of stopping. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Continuous playback across recording segments". |
| 8 | ✅ done | Day timeline scrubber for playback — horizontal bar showing the loaded day's recorded segments/gaps, click-to-seek, reusing the existing playback-start/gap-clamp mechanism. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Day timeline scrubber". |

Detailed findings for each completed phase (exact endpoints, bugs
found and fixed, design decisions) are in `ARCHITECTURE.md` rather than
duplicated here — this file tracks *what's done and what's next*, not
*how it works*.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Two-way audio talk-back.
- Multi-DVR / multi-site management (single DVR target for v1).
- Mobile app — web UI only, works fine from a phone browser on LAN.
- Exact UI/UX parity with Hikvision's own web interface — functional parity, not a visual clone.

## Next step

Phase 6 — packaging: systemd service + install script, playback-path
garbage collection (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` known gaps), event/alarm
stream, basic auth on the local UI.
